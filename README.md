# NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2023
## Immersed in the Sounds of Space

### Whats the challenge

The challenge is to create sonifications for 3D NASA space datasets, exploring various ways to convey the richness of this data through sound. This may involve converting 3D 'data cubes' into audio representations that capture the essence of the information. It could also extend to creating sonification fly-throughs by translating video imagery into accurate sound representations.
